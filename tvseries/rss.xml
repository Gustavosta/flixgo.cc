<description><![CDATA[It is already known that the third season of the television series will be 8 episodes. That is one fewer than in the previous year. The action will take place in the year 1985. This, by the way, there is a very logical explanation Matt Daffera (one of the brothers, creators of the "Stranger Things"): "we can't stay in the year 1984, and cannot so simply travel back on 10 years backward or forward. Children grow very definitely. When will be season 3, they will be plus one year, and it will be noticeable. You know, I even like it. Audience matures, together with our heroes. Viewers will see how children reach adulthood. That's cool! "]]></description>
